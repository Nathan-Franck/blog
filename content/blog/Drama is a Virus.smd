I have to be really careful when going on social media, particularly YouTube. The ideal flow is that before opening the app, I asked myself what I'm looking for and I have a good answer. whether it's technology development, news, finances, if I come into the app with a solid answer for where I'm going to go, then there's a much stronger chance that I'll use my time effectively on the app 

YouTube recommendations however have a different plan. These thumbnails say "Don't do this" or "Don't be that guy". I can consciously see them and ignore them, but the fact that they exist shows how people are driven to watch things out of fear and survival 

The drama genre of social media content is especially virally toxic. these videos generally get lots and lots of attention and therefore social media platforms will push these videos more and more. however, the reason they get attention at all is sure some real outrage from one side, but from the other side is a visceral sense of fear. "What would happen if I was that guy" or "What would I do in this situation" questions basically have to be explored because of the power of these videos - because of how many views they get. So people that aren't actually interested in the drama are sucked in so that they can learn how to avoid drama or the consequences of drama.

Because YouTube and other social media platforms seek to amplify things that people already find interesting, Drama is real toxic sludge. The only hope of societally lessening the power of toxic drama is to actively suppress the genre as a whole. any video where the main discourse is attacking a medium to small creator needs to be actively suppressed to counter the force of viral spread. Only then will drama videos not need to be watched out of survival - once they have no power.

Of course there's no incentive for any of the social media websites to work on this problem or solve it. I guess it's probably up to people's governments to put pressure on these websites to protect their own citizens.

Until then, by participating online, you are actively rolling the dice every time you post on whether or not you will have a life-altering event happen to you. So the drama consumption must continue.
